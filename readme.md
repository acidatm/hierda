# Von Hier nach Da

"Von Hier nach Da" ("From here to there") is performance I created for the Backstage Festival 2022 at Deutsches Schauspielhaus Hamburg. It happens during a formal reading. Each visitor is presented with a QR code linking to a hosted website containing the "index.html" file of this repo. The room is then asked to read the text out loud as a choir.

The text consists of exactly 200 words, 100 times the word "Hier", 100 times the word "Da". The text transitions from only reading the word "Hier" to only reading the word "Da". Inbetween both words can be read.

All readers are viewing a unique version of the text. Word count, paragraph count and length as well as total number of "Hier" and "Da" are the same for everyone. However the way in which the text transitions from "Hier" to "Da" is unique for everyone.

I want to play on the fact that no one expects a website to look the same for everyone. When you look into your Instagram you do not believe everybody sees the same page as you do. However with written text, Wikipedia for instance, this is different. Here we think that what we have infront of us is true, unchangable and applies to everyone in the same way.

Another thing I want to emphasize on is how we always look around us for orientation, believing someone around us knows what \* is doing. Which might actually not be the case as everyone is just freestyling it. This is exactly what I hope will happen during the reading of this text.
